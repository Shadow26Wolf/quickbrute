# quickbrute

This project was pretty much a yoink of https://github.com/MS-WEB-BN/t14m4t so ima give all credit to them. Also this uses https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu and https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa so you will need those to be installed, thanks to projectdiscovery for all of their new tools :) they are great.

there is much work and refactoring to be done here, please ignore how awful i am at coding, i am not a programmer by any means. I simply saw t14m4t and wanted it to go faster (and be a little more customizable)

im releasing this right now as i would like to see if anyone would actually find this useful lol.

p.s i would just `git clone` this repo and use `go run` because i havent sorted downloading the wordlist yet. anyway, have fun with this i guess

use `quickbrute -help` to see usage

:)

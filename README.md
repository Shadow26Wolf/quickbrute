# quickbrute

This project was pretty much a yoink of https://github.com/MS-WEB-BN/t14m4t so ima give all credit to them.

there is much work and refactoring to be done here, please ignore how awful i am at coding, i am not a programmer by any means. I simply saw t14m4t and wanted it to go faster (and be a little more customizable)

right now the project only has support for ssh, although im probably gonna add support for the rest of the services tommorow when i wake up. also i yoinked t14m4t's wordlist files i hope they dont mind :) 

im releasing this right now as i would like to see if anyone would actually find this useful lol.

p.s i would just `git clone` this repo and use `go run` because i havent sorted downloading the wordlist yet. anyway, have fun with this i guess

use `quickbrute -help` to see usage

:)
